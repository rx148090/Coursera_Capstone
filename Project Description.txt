Segmentation of VA cities concerning data science companies and venues

According to the publication on virginiabusiness.com in 2019, Virginia is ranked sixth nationwide in net tech employment and 12th in net tech jobs added 2018. This capstone project tries to understand how technology companies are geographically aggregated and examine if there are any different characteristics among different cities in terms of the number of data science job posts and venue types. The project analyzes geographical data by clustering Virginia neighborhoods based on tech job locations and venues.

This project combines two data sets. The first one is a 10000 data science job posting from the USA provided on kaggle.com. This data set covers the job listing for data scientists from the United States extracted from popular job boards via JobsPikr. Although there are various natural language processing analysis can be done on this data set, for this project, I only used part of it and aggregate it with query results from Foursquare.com database. The second part of the data set contains the top 100 venues in each city for all listed cities. In this project, I use all features from the combined data set and cluster similar cities using K-Means clustering. I then take the results and plot each city on the map layered with a choropleth map showing the number of data science jobs per county.
